More on sed
The stream editor, sed, is a non-interactive editor. It interprets a script and performs the actions in the script. sed is stream-oriented because, like many Unix-like programs, inputs flows through the program and is directed to standard output (making it ideal for pipes). Typical uses:
    1. Editing one or more files automatically
    2. Simplifying repetitive edits to multiple files
    3. Writing conversion programs
sed operates as follows
    1. Each line of input is copied into a pattern space as an internal buffer where editing operations are performed. All editing commands in a sed script are applied, in order, to each line of input. Editing commands are applied to all lines globally unless addressing restricts the lines affected.
    2. If a command changes the input, subsequent commands and address tests will be applied to the current line in the pattern space, not the original input line.
