Redirection

With Input/Output (I/O) redirection we can redirect the input and output of commands to and from files, as well as connect multiple commands to make powerful commands called pipelines.

# Redirection Commands
cat         Concatenate files
sort        Sort lines of text
uniq        report or omit repeated lines
wc          Print newline, word, and byte counts for each file
head        Output the first part (tail for last part)
tee         Read from standard input and write to standard output and files

Everything is a file
One of the thems of Unix is that everything is a file. Programs like ls actually send their results to a special file called standard output (stdout) and their status message to another file called standard error (stderr). These are, by default, linked to the screen and not saved to disk. 
In addition, many programs (although not all) take input from a facility called standard input (stdin), which is, by default, linked to the keyboard.
I/O redirection allows us to redefine where standard output and input go to.

Redirecting standard ouput
To redirect (and overwrite) to a file:
	ls -l /usr/bin > ls-output.txt
	cat * > all_files.txt
To redirect (and append) to a file:
	ls -l /usr/bin > ls-output.txt

Redirecting standard error
To redirect (and overwrite) the standard error to a file:
	ls -l /usr/bin 2> ls-error.txt

Redirecting both standard output and error
To redirect both
	ls -l /usr/bin > ls-output.txt 2>&1
Two redirections with this method. Newer versions of bash allow this:
	ls -l /usr/bin &> ls-output.txt

Redirecting standard input
	cat < output*.txt
This is of course the same as:
	cat output*.txt
So it's not very useful but it demonstrates that the second is actually using the file as a source of standard input. There is actually redirection going on!


Pipelines
These can be used to pipe the stdout of one command to the stdin of another:
	cat *.txt | less

	Filters
	Text can be filtered easily using commands like sort, uniq, head, tail and grep

	Creating a T
	Linux provides a command called tee that allows both redirection to both standard output and one or more files. This allows us to pick text off at a particular point in our pipe.
