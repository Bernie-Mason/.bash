BASH - creating a new repo from existing file set

nav to file in bash

$git init 

This initialises new repository. 

$git add .
$git commit 'commit message'

Now we need to add a remote. Note that the remote HAS to be empty otherwise you're going to get issues. Not even a readme in the remote. If you haven't already created a remote, go to github and do this.

Now get the url of the remote and do this

$ git remote add origin <url>

You won't be able to push yet as your branch (probably master) won't yet have an upstream branch. You'll get this error message

$ git push
fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master
