Debugging
Git has a fairly complete set of traces (environmental variables) embedded which you can use to debug your git problems.

To turn them on, you can define the following variables:

GIT_TRACE for general traces,
GIT_TRACE_PACK_ACCESS for tracing of packfile access,
GIT_TRACE_PACKET for packet-level tracing for network operations,
GIT_TRACE_PERFORMANCE for logging the performance data,
GIT_TRACE_SETUP for information about discovering the repository and environment itâ€™s interacting with,
GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY for debugging recursive merge strategy (values: 0-5),
GIT_CURL_VERBOSE for logging all curl messages (equivalent to curl -v),
GIT_TRACE_SHALLOW for debugging fetching/cloning of shallow repositories.

To see the full list of git environmental variables see: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Environment-Variables

For example:

GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 GIT_TRACE=1 git pull origin master
