ssh_key

Adding a key by the command line.

Step 1. Set up your default identity

$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (e.g. ~/.ssh/id_rsa or ~/.ssh/bitbucket_id_rsa)
This will create a key but not do anything with it yet.

Step 2. Add the key to the ssh-agent

2.1 To start the authentication agent, run the following:
$ eval $(ssh-agent)
Agent pid 9700

2.2 Enter ssh-add followed by the path to the private key file to add the key to the authentication agent:
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/<private_key_file>

Step 3. Add the public key to your Account settings (github/bitbucket etc)

Step 4. Verify it worked. For example:
$ ssh -v git@bitbucket.thinksmartbox.com

And check that ~/.ssh/config is configurated correctly. 
* The host has to be the correct domain
* The hostname can either be the domain or local ip address (if you're on a VPN for example)
* The port number by default is 22 for ssh. If this is different (I'm looking at you bitbucket) then you'll need to change this.

Step 5. Use ssh instead of https!
If you were using ssh previously, you'll need to change the url of your remote. You can see your current remote thus:
$ git remote -vv
origin  https://bitbucket.thinksmartbox.com/scm/libs/shared.git (fetch)
origin  https://bitbucket.thinksmartbox.com/scm/libs/shared.git (push)

Whilst in the repository you want to change, you can change the remote thus:
$ git remote set-url origin ssh://git@bitbucket.thinksmartbox.com:7999/libs/shared.git

Bitbucket: Note that you'll need to consult bitbucket for the exact url of the ssh remote. The urls for https vs shh will often simply differ by the protocol but sometimes don't.
