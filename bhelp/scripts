Shell scripts

A shell script is a file containing a series of commands. The shell reads this file and carries out the command.

Steps for making a script
	1. Write the bugger. Ordinary text file. Needs to start with a shebang (i.e. #!/bin/bash) but otherwise can just be a series of commands and functions.
	2. Make the script executable. Set file permissions using chmod (i.e. chmod 755 or 700).
	3. Put the script somewhere the shell can find it. The shell automatically searches certain directories for executable files when no explicit path is specified.
		For example in ~/.bash/antergos_vb/config: export PATH="${PATH}:/home/bernie/bin"
