Wildcard        Matches
*               Any character
?               Any single character
[characters]    Any character that is a member of a set of characters i.e. [abef] or [a-z]
[!characters]   Not case of above
[[:class:]]     Where clas is alnum, alpha, digit, upper and lower

The final classes are character classes and should be used instead of ranges like [A-Z] where possible.

Pathname expansion
The mechanism by which wildcards work is called pathname expansion.

Uses:
Use cp -u (update) *.html destination to copy
 all html files from your current folder to a
 destination folder.
Use echo * to like ls. 


Regex similarities
A wildcard is a generic term referring to something that can be substituted for all possibilities; like a joker being a wildcard in poker. A regular expression includes such functionality but also has much, much more in terms of your ability to restrict characters and flexibility in the number of characters you want to match.
