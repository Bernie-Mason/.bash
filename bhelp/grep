#grep

How to search for string patterns within files

grep uses regular expressions and most of it's power comes from their flexibility. Real mastery of grep comes with mastery of regex. The name grep comes from a command used in one of the early Unix editors. The command searched for a regular expression, and printed it out. g/string/p where g indicates a global search and p indicates that you wish the result to printed. As regular expression can be shortened to re this becomes g/re/p.
