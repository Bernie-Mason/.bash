# You start a bisect with:

$ git bisect start

# If you're on a commit with the bug/error you can do: 
$ git bisect bad                 # Current version is bad

# Then reference the commit hash or tag where the bug/error doesn't exist
$ git bisect good v2.6.13-rc2    # v2.6.13-rc2 is known to be good


# We then work through each commit that the bisect selects, marking them as good or bad.

# To end the bisect run

$ git bisect reset
