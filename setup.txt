SETUP PROCESS

1. If on Windows, update your windows path to include the following: 
	%USERPROFILE%\.bash\_ENTER_HOSTNAME_HERE_\Scripts
	%USERPROFILE%\.bash\Global\Scripts
	%USERPROFILE%\.bash\Global\Scripts\Powershell
	%USERPROFILE%\.bash\Global\Vendor
2. Create bash configuration files. 
	a. In .bash/.bash_core create .bashrc, .bash_profile and .gitconfig configuration files as desired. You can run generate-bash-core-files to generate blank files with the correct naming
	b. Copy/write config into these files as desired
	c. Run propagate-bash-config to copy these files into your user folder
	d. When making changes to configuration you can make changes to files in use and run backup-bash-config when you're done OR make changes to the files in .bash_core and run propagate-bash-config to propagate your changes out of the working directory.
