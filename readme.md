# - readme for .bash setup
#

This endevours to be a cross-platform bash shell configuration. In the global folder there are scripts, aliases and configuration files that are used on all devices as all as machine specific files for all these things. The folder named .bash_core contains copies of original .bashrc and .bash_profile files from their respective machines and are suffixed with their hostnames. All other non-hidden folders in the root directory are named after their host machine and contain settings for use only on their specific machines.

The aim of this setup is to keep a global set of scripts, aliases and other settings that can be modified and used across any machine.
